# Simple Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) in PHP & MySQL using Object Oriented Programming (OOP) 

- This is an adaptation ( changing mysqli to PDO class) of the original code made by chapagain here [PHP: CRUD article using OOP](http://blog.chapagain.com.np/php-crud-add-edit-delete-view-application-using-oop-object-oriented-programming/).
- The original code can be seen on first commit. You can access it by clonning this project and running:
`````
git checkout 9db1658
`````
- And return to the final commit by running:
`````
git checkout main
`````
